From Shopee Code League Round #1: "Order Brushing"

Order brushing is the act of online sellers gaming Shopee's ecommerce platform by creating fake buyer accounts to buy from their own stores to artificially inflate the ratings of their own stores.

Each team needs to process the dataset "order_brush_order.csv" and determine which stores and buyers are guilty of such behavior.
